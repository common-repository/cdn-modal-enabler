Enable the modal image when using a CDN in the tagDiv Newspaper theme - switch off global modal image in settings.

== Description ==

The Newspaper and Newsmag themes do not support the modal when using a CDN. This plugin works around that, and allows you to use the modal whilst using a subdomain, or different domain, to serve your images.

Also works if you use domain sharding.
